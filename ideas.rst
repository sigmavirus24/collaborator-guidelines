Requirements
------------

**tl;dr**:

1. Collaborate
2. Consistently
3. Constructively
4. Respectfully

Collaborators must always follow the Code of Conduct, model the expected behaviour, and be willing to correct others (including other core collaborators) when they violate the CoC.

Collaborators need to consistently (not necessarily daily, weekly, or monthly) help triage issues (See triaging issues below).

Collaborators need to consistently provide constructive code review for other collaborators and should be willing to help new collaborators in a welcoming and inclusive manner.

Collaborators should occasionally submit changes of their own. Changes can include documentation, packaging, tests, and code.

Issue Triage
------------

- Ensuring all information is provided: Sometimes bug reporters don't provide quite enough information to reproduce an issue. If you notice some of the standard information missing, gently asking for them to provide that helps other core collaborators save some time in asking that as well.
- Reproducing: When all of the information is present, attempting to reproduce the reported issue and confirming it can save core collaborators time as well. If you can not reproduce it, explaining how you tried can sometimes coax more relevant information out of the reporter or just start a conversation about the bug that could lead to its resolution.
  - Reproducing on different Operating Systems: Sometimes a bug only shows up on Windows or BSD. If you have access to either of those, reproducing their and helping test fixes is **immensely helpful**.
- Determining severity/workarounds: If you can help find a way to work around the bug until the next release with a fix, this is also helpful to the users. You can also help us determine the priority and severity of an issue this way.
- Keeping track of issues that have fixes committed: Sometimes core collaborators lose track of issues that have been fixed or even released. Gently reminding us to close them is appreciated :)

Code Review
-----------

- Quality code review involves:

  - Reading the code: Look at the diff on the website and leave *constructive* feedback or just questions inline. For example, issues of personal style or taste should not be brought up. If you do notice, however, that the code does not match the project style you can ask why they diverged from that.
  - Downloading the code and testing that it actually does what it should
  - Respectfully asking questions
